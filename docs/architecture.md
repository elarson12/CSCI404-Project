# Cyberattack Threat Characterization System - Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Cyberattack Threat Characterization System, including its components, data flow, and key algorithms.

## System Architecture

The system consists of four main components that work together to characterize cyberattack threats:

1. **Threat Data Input Mechanism**: Imports threat data from public and private sources
2. **System Scan Data Input Mechanism**: Collects network and system configuration data
3. **Threat Identification Mechanism**: Matches threat data with scan results
4. **Threat Characterization Mechanism**: Analyzes the potential impact of identified threats

## Component Descriptions

### 1. Threat Data Input Mechanism

**Purpose**: Import and standardize threat data from various sources.

**Modules**:
- `data_importer.py`: Fetches threat data from configured sources
- `threat_database.py`: Manages local threat database

**Data Sources**:
- Public vulnerability databases (NVD, CVE)
- Threat intelligence feeds
- Local threat database

### 2. System Scan Data Input Mechanism

**Purpose**: Collect information about the target system.

**Modules**:
- `port_scanner.py`: Scans target for open ports
- `service_detector.py`: Identifies services running on open ports
- `system_info.py`: Gathers system information

**Techniques**:
- TCP/UDP port scanning
- Service banner grabbing
- Version detection

### 3. Threat Identification Mechanism

**Purpose**: Match threat data with scan results to identify potential threats.

**Modules**:
- `matcher.py`: Implements the threat matching algorithm
- `risk_assessor.py`: Assesses the risk level of identified threats

**Matching Criteria**:
- Port matching
- Service matching
- Version matching
- Pattern matching

### 4. Threat Characterization Mechanism

**Purpose**: Analyze the potential impact of identified threats.

**Modules**:
- `impact_analyzer.py`: Analyzes potential impact of threats
- `report_generator.py`: Generates detailed reports

**Analysis Factors**:
- Data breach potential
- Service disruption impact
- Lateral movement potential
- Mitigation complexity

## Data Flow

1. The system starts by importing threat data from configured sources.
2. It scans the target system for open ports and detects running services.
3. Threat data is matched against scan results to identify potential threats.
4. Identified threats are assessed for risk based on multiple factors.
5. The potential impact of threats is analyzed.
6. A comprehensive report is generated.

## Key Algorithms

### Threat Matching Algorithm

The threat matching algorithm uses multiple criteria to identify potential threats:

1. **Port Matching**: Matches open ports with ports affected by known threats
2. **Service Matching**: Matches detected services with services affected by known threats
3. **Version Matching**: Compares service versions with vulnerable versions
4. **Pattern Matching**: Searches for patterns in service banners and system information

Each match type contributes to an overall confidence score, which determines if a threat is relevant.

### Risk Assessment Algorithm

The risk assessment algorithm calculates a risk score based on:

1. **Threat Severity**: Base risk from the threat's severity level
2. **Confidence**: Confidence of the threat match
3. **Port Exposure**: Criticality of the affected ports
4. **Exploitability**: Ease of exploitation
5. **Network Exposure**: Overall network exposure

### Impact Analysis Algorithm

The impact analysis algorithm evaluates potential impact based on:

1. **Data Breach Impact**: Potential for data disclosure
2. **Service Disruption Impact**: Potential for service disruption
3. **Lateral Movement Impact**: Potential for network penetration

## Configuration

The system is configured using two main files:

1. **settings.json**: General settings for the application
2. **threat_sources.json**: Configuration for threat data sources

## Extensibility

The system is designed to be extensible through:

1. **Pluggable Threat Sources**: New sources can be added in the configuration
2. **Custom Detection Rules**: New detection patterns can be added
3. **Output Formats**: Multiple report formats are supported

## Performance Considerations

- Parallel port scanning for faster results
- On-demand threat data updates
- Configurable scan depth and timeout
- Incremental scanning capabilities

## Security Considerations

1. The system is designed for defensive security assessment only
2. Requires proper authorization before scanning any system
3. Logs all activities for audit purposes
4. Does not perform active exploitation attempts
